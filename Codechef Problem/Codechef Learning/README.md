### Basics of C++
##### 1. Syntax Breakdown
#### 2.Variable
A variable is like a labeled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labeled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. In C++, you would do this by writing int age = 25;. This means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.

int denotes that we will be storing integers (numbers) in this variable.
